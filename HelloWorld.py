# Whats up broo...
# So this is a python(programming languege, we have tons) script.
# But in order for you to understand everything you'll need to go thru err step(faxx)
# ----So for this first exercise you'll write the goodOld HelloWorld programme
# consider this you first ever piece of code.

# 1.We have what we call the print function aka print()
# this print is able to print out any value passed thru it 
# (given that there are no errors on the code)
# 2.--usage:
# print()
# in the brackets would be whatever you wanna print ayt
# 3. so since we have different values for all symbols and numbers,
# the print() needs to know the type of variable passed
# 
# 4. so sentences or numbers(not possible to add the together)for ya to print  


def first_code():
    # Write you code below this comment
    name = 'HelloWorld'
    strings = "s"



    return name,strings

print(first_code())
