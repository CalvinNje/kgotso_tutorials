This marks your first piece of code, Coder.
So we'll start with "strings" and print()


Python Variable
    Python Variable is containers which store values.
    Python is not “statically typed”. 
    We do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type. 
    A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it. 
    A Python variable is a name given to a memory location. 
    It is the basic unit of storage in a program.
    usage:
        variable = "It could be a sentence or a"
        another_variable = "word"
        
    But note that there are some rules when declaring a function.
        A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
        A variable name cannot start with a number.
        A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
        Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables).
        The reserved words(keywords) cannot be used naming the variable.(you'll catch up later on this)

Python String
    A string is a series of characters.
    In Python, anything inside quotes is a string.
    And you can use either single or double quotes.
    For example: 
        message = 'This is a string in Python' 
        message = "This is also a string"
        message = "Numbers can be included but can't be used for math. Di in String form."


Python "print()" Function

The print() function prints the specified message to the screen,
    or other standard output device.
    The message can be a string, or any other object,
    the object will be converted into a string before written to the screen.

    usage (In a Python file ofcourse):
        print("the string you want to print, note in quote marks or apostrophes")
    or you can pass thru variable, message (from strings:chapter)
        print(message)

---Task---

We'll be working on the file HelloWorld.py . 
I take it you'll be able to:
    1. Define a variable
    2. Equate the variable to a certain value
    3. And be able to print it either in variable form or "a string in print"

    What to do:
    
    On the code HelloWorld, Define a variables, hello and strings,
    assign hello to HelloWorld
    assign strings to Don't forget quote mark when working with strings.
    write two print functions to print each value
